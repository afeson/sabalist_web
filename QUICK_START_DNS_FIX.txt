QUICK START: Fix Hostinger DNS for AWS Amplify
========================================

STEP 1: Get Hostinger API Token
--------------------------------
1. The browser should have opened: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/api-tokens
2. Log into Hostinger if prompted
3. Click "Create API Token"
4. Give it a name like "AWS Amplify DNS"
5. Select permissions: "Manage DNS records"
6. Click "Create"
7. COPY the token (you won't see it again!)

STEP 2: Run the Fix Script
---------------------------
1. Double-click: fix-dns.bat
2. Paste your Hostinger API token when prompted
3. Press Enter
4. The script will automatically:
   ✓ Delete old CAA records
   ✓ Add AWS CAA records
   ✓ Add SSL verification CNAME
   ✓ Add domain routing CNAMEs

STEP 3: Wait and Verify
------------------------
1. Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Run: verify-dns.bat
3. Check AWS Amplify Console for domain status

========================================
FILES CREATED:
========================================
1. fix-dns.bat - Main script to run
2. fix-hostinger-dns.ps1 - PowerShell automation
3. verify-dns.bat - Verification script
4. HOSTINGER_DNS_SETUP.md - Detailed manual guide

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

If script fails with "API token" error:
- Make sure you created the token with "DNS" permissions
- Token must be for the account that owns sabalist.com
- Try regenerating the token if it's expired

If DNS doesn't update:
- Check Hostinger email for any security confirmations
- Wait longer (up to 48h for full propagation)
- Contact Hostinger support

If AWS Amplify still shows "Pending":
- Verify CNAME records are correct with verify-dns.bat
- Check AWS Amplify logs for specific errors
- May need to remove and re-add domain in Amplify

========================================
EXPECTED RESULT:
========================================

Within 30 minutes, you should see:
✓ AWS Amplify domain status: "Available"
✓ SSL certificate issued
✓ sabalist.com redirects to your Amplify app
✓ HTTPS working automatically

========================================
